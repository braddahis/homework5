# homework5
Requested extension to complete homework5 by Jan 4th per my instructors acceptance of my request.  
Attempted to complete challenge 5 with tutor however, I had no clue what I was doing. 
I was rushed to finish mulitple challenges and was only able to complete the first half of the challenge.
This was my mistake and regretably I am forced to submit now with what I have done as anything is better than a 0 as instructed by my TA.
